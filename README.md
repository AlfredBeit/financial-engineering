## [Merton's Jump Diffusion Model](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/federicomariamassari/financial-engineering/blob/master/handbook/01-merton-jdm.ipynb) (1976)
This is an application of **Monte Carlo methods** [1] to the pricing of options on stocks when the underlying asset has occasional jumps in the trajectories. Merton [2] describes such jumps as _"idiosynchratic shocks affecting an individual company but not the market as a whole"_. The jump component makes the distribution of prices _leptokurtic_ (high peak, heavy tails), a feature typical of market data.

The model builds on the _standard Brownian motion_, which can also be generated using the [willow tree](https://github.com/federicomariamassari/willow-tree).
